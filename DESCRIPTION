Description: This package interfaces with the R API from Mendeley
    It currently supports a small subset of the API, but enough for my simple needs.
    The package does not yet provide a stable API and will be abandoned when
    Mendeley provides a better alternative. I do not plan to submit it to CRAN.
    I am looking forward to stop using mendeleyr as the package name if Mendeley
    decides to use it.
